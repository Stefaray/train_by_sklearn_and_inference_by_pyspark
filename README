Project Introduction:
The project is a demo to show the process of training a model by sklearn and inferencing a model by pyspark.


File Introduction:
[1]The file "lg_generate.py" trains a logistics regression model by sklearn and saves the trained model by generating a file named "lg_model.pkl".
[2]The file "lg_pred_V2.py" loads the model trained by the first file and broadcasts it to all compute nodes in spark framework. So different nodes can predict the test dataset in the same time.
